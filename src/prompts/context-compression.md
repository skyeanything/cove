You are summarizing a conversation for context continuity.

Rules:
1. Preserve ALL key facts, decisions, file paths, code changes, and outcomes
2. Summarize tool actions as natural language (e.g., "Read file X, found Y")
3. Omit pleasantries, filler, and redundant back-and-forth
4. Use the SAME LANGUAGE as the conversation
5. Format as a structured list grouped by topic
6. Be concise but complete — nothing important should be lost
