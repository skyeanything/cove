Switch models mid-conversation with `Cmd+/` or the model selector in the toolbar.

## Tools

All tools are available by default. Category determines gating.

### Built-in (always available)

| Edit File | Apply targeted edits to an existing file |
| Shell Command | Execute a shell command |
| Fetch URL | Fetch content from a URL as text |

### Skill-bundled (available when parent skill is enabled)

| Tool | Skill | Description |

| Diagram | office | Render diagrams to images |
| Create Skill | skill-creator | Save a skill to user's Cove skill directory |

View all tools in Settings > Tools.

## @Mention

Type `@` in the chat input to trigger autocomplete. Three categories:

- **Tools** — e.g. `@tool:bash`. Guides the AI toward using a specific tool.
- **Skills** — e.g. `@skill:skill-creator`. Loads a skill's instructions.
- **Files** — e.g. `@file:src/main.ts`. Includes file content in the message.

`@` must appear at line start or after whitespace. Popover closes on space within the query.

## Skills

Modular capability packs. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

- Enable/disable in Settings > Skills
- Three sources: built-in (bundled in app), user (`~/.cove/skills/`), discovered (from other tools)
- `cove` core skill is always active (provides JS interpreter rules)
- Create custom skills by enabling `skill-creator` and asking the AI
